## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

1. How to use Tailwind CSS
2. Effect of line-spacing attribute

### Continued development

As of 2025-02-07, I'd like to continue to focus on using semantic HTML elements more effectively as well as avoiding using text content elements when semantic elements fit better.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - I referred to it every time I needed to style an element.
- [Google Fonts (Outfit)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This is where I got the Outfit font.
